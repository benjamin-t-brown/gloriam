cSpell:words Rydo Elkhain Siffsbury Siff Siff's Ferelith Bromly Velta

Start with two branching storylines.

-- Rydo --

Lord Rydo Elkhain arrives to Siffsbury Castle via carriage.  He intends to request an audience with the Lord of Siffsbury to ask for the patronage that the the Siff crown has always provided his kingdom.  When he tries to get into the castle, he is denied entry.  The guards do not know who he is, despite the fact that Rydo had sent word of his arrival beforehand.  Rydo gains entry into the castle by being annoyingly persistent, and eventually he finds his way into Lord Siff's main chamber.

-- Ferelith -- 

Ferelith exits from the kitchens after stealing a large bag of muffins.  She tries to sneak back to her quarters when she is discovered by the stuffy guard Bromly, who insists that put them back where she found them, since she is not allowed to have muffins taken from Lord Siff's storehouse.  Ferelith argues with him, but he threatens to tell Lord Siff, and she begrudgingly backs down.  Furious, she concocts an elaborate prank on him.  It somewhat backfires, and she gets caught, eventually dragged into Lord Siff's main chamber.

-- Siff CutScene -- 

Lord Siff sits in his chamber, weary and tired.  There's a gem on his deck, pulsing with red light.  He remarks to his bodyguard, Sir Velta, about he has one of the most powerful objects in the kingdom, just sitting on his desk, and he doesn't know what to do with it.  Velta says he can do with it what he wants.  There's a knock at the door, and Siff asks Velta to take care of the rock.  Velta takes it out of the room.

In walks Bromly pushing Ferelith in front of her.  He explains what she has done (indignantly) and asks for him to administer a punishment.  He remarks that she should stay out of trouble, to which Ferelith sniffs.  Before he can speak further though, the door to his bedroom opens and in walks Rydo, who is does not care that he has barged in on something.  He strides to Siff and asks him why his request for patronage was denied.  The guards stationed in the room point their spears at him and he is disgruntled that they don't show him more respect.

Lord Siff diffuses the situation, and is struck by an idea.  He tells Rydo that he should be imprisoned for breaking and entering, and he tells Ferelith that she should be expelled from the magic school here for causing him so much trouble.  However, he is feeling bored today.  He would like a little excitement.  He wants to hold a Gauntlet.  The school has several magical creatures they have been harboring and he has been waiting for an opportunity to see them in action.  They will provide a set of ten challenges for Rydo and Ferelith to fight.  Both of them protest, but Siff reminds them of what he can do to them.  He also says that, if they finish the entire gauntlet, Rydo can have his patronage, and Ferelith can have "undisputed access to the kitchens."
