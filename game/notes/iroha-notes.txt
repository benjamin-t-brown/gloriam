[Even as a child, I had always been interested in games.]
Iroha: "Mom, can we play Go Fish again?"
Mom: "Again? We've played ten times today already!"
Iroha: "It's FUN!"
Mom: "Perhaps another time, honey.  Mommy has some work to do."

[Some I am very good at.]
- in an arcade at a fighting game station
Iroha: "SORRY! Ahahaha."
Boy: *grumbles*
Iroha: "So who's next!"
- turns to see a long line of contestants

[Others... Well at least they are still fun!]
Boy: "Checkmate!"
Iroha: "The knight can move like that?!"

[If there is somebody nearby playing something... I always want to know what is.]
Iroha: "What are you kids up to?"
Surly Kid: "Fortnight."
Iroha: "Can I watch?"
- shouts at kid to shoot that guy!

[Because to me, discovering something new in game is special.]
Iroha: "Oh! What's that!"
Boy: "It's just a wooden chest, there's probably nothing exciting inside--"
Iroha: "How do I get up there!?"

[Even the old ones are a new experience.]
- bargain bin antique store
Iroha: "King's Quest?  What's this?"

[So when I discovered the treasure trove in my uncle's attic...]
- Climbing into attic, look back at uncle
Imani: "Watch your step, Iroha.  That ladder's always been rickety."
Iroha: "I'll be careful!"
- look of wonder, closeup

[...I became very excited.]
- angle from back pointing at the setup
Iroha: "A Tyzon GP Setup!?"
Iroha: "How on earth did he get one these..."

[Games lost to time, only playable on the most exclusive console ever made.  I had never been able to find even videos of these titles.]

[One struck my eye immediately.]
Iroha: "Gloriam."
[I thought I knew of all the games for this console.  But I didn't know about this one.]
- closeup of box art

[So of course, I had to play it.]
- boots up game.
