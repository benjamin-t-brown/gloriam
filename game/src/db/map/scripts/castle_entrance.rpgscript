Rydo: "Hello there good sir!"
Rydo: "I am Lord Rydo."
Rydo: "I'm certain you've been expecting me."
Gate Guard: "A Guard at Siffsbury Castle must expect many things!"
Gate Guard: "An attack can come at any moment."
Gate Guard: "Like right now!"

+setAnimationState(Rydo, default);
Rydo: "That is very sage advice, friend."
Rydo: "But might I humbly request that you to let me pass?"
Rydo: "I seek the throne room!"
Rydo: "I have a very important request for the King that I must give in person."
Gate Guard: "The throne room!"
Gate Guard: "That room is closely guarded!"
Gate Guard: "(Might he be an assassin in disguise?)"

Rydo: "Why... you are speaking to the illustrious Lord Rydo..."
Rydo: "...from the great lands of Elkhain!"
Gate Guard: "AHA!"
+lookAt('Rydo', 'Gate Guard');
Gate Guard: "I knew you were an assassin!"
Gate Guard: "No lands of that name exist!"
Gate Guard: "To think you sought to outwit me with such a far-fetched story..."
+waitMS(200);
Rydo: "*ahem*"
Rydo: "You must be mistaken..."
Rydo: "Elkhain most certainly exists."
Rydo: "It, of course, resides in the Florwitch Valley to the far north."
Rydo: "One must take the Warlow Road through the Angol Mountains."
Rydo: "A long and treacherous journey, truth be told..."
Rydo: "...But a man such as I of pure Elkhain heritage could not be stopped on this important quest!"
Gate Guard: "Your words belay your lies!"
Gate Guard: "The Warlow Road ends at the Angol Mountains!"
Gate Guard: "Everyone knows that!"
Rydo: "I'm afraid you have me at a loss..."
Rydo: "The road does continue there."
Rydo: "Elkhain does indeed exist."
Rydo: "I do not know what further to say."

Gate Guard: "No more lies!"

Rydo: "I have *great* *need*."
Rydo: "I must get to the throne room."

Gate Guard: "Stay back, ruffian!"
Gate Guard: "Any closer and I'll gut you like a kabaab."

Rydo: "What a bafoon of a man!"
Rydo: "I cannot believe King Siff lets such people guard his gates."
Rydo: "If he won't let me through, then perhaps I'll have to find another way inside."
